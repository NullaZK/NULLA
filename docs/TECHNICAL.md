# Privacy Blockchain - Technical Documentation 

## Technical Architecture Overview

This privacy blockchain implements a substrate-based architecture with quantified cryptographic primitives for comprehensive transaction privacy while maintaining network integrity and consensus.

**Security Level**: 128-bit computational security (2^128 operations)
**Consensus**: GRANDPA finality + BABE block production
**Target Performance**: 1000+ TPS (100+ TPS current production deployment)

## Core Technical Components

### Stealth Addresses System
**Cryptographic Foundation**: Curve25519 elliptic curve with compressed point operations

**Mathematical Specification**:
```
Stealth Address Generation: P = H(rA)G + B
where:
- r = ephemeral scalar (32 bytes)
- A = recipient view key (32 bytes)  
- B = recipient spend key (32 bytes)
- G = curve generator point
- H = Blake2b-512 hash function
```

**Key Derivation Protocol**:
```
View Key: k_v = H(seed || "view") mod n
Spend Key: k_s = H(seed || "spend") mod n
Child Keys: k' = H(k || index || chain_code) mod n
```

Technical specifications:
- **Curve Parameters**: Curve25519 (y² = x³ + 486662x² + x)
- **Point Compression**: 32-byte compressed representation
- **Key Size**: 256-bit private keys, 32-byte public keys
- **Hash Function**: Blake2b-512 (64-byte output)
- **View Tag Optimization**: 1-byte tags for 99.6% scan reduction
- **Security**: Discrete logarithm hardness assumption

**Performance Metrics**:

- Address Derivation: 0.6ms (median)
- Scanning Efficiency: 256:1 improvement with view tags
- Storage per Address: 64 bytes (view + spend keys)

### Zero-Knowledge Transactions Engine
**Proof System**: Bulletproof+ range proofs with Fiat-Shamir heuristic

**Verification Equation**:
```
Pairing Verification: e(π_A, g_2) = e(g_1^α, π_B) · e(g_1^β, π_C)
Range Proof: Bulletproof(v, r) proves v ∈ [0, 2^64]
Nullifier: N = H(sk || commitment) prevents double-spending
```

**Commitment Scheme**:
```
Pedersen Commitment: C = vG + rH
where:
- v = hidden value (64-bit)
- r = blinding factor (256-bit)
- G, H = independent generators on Ristretto255
```

Technical parameters:
- **Curve**: Ristretto255 (prime-order group)
- **Range**: 64-bit values (0 to 2^64 - 1)
- **Proof Size**: 672 bytes (logarithmic in range)
- **Security**: 128-bit discrete logarithm security
- **Aggregation**: O(log n) verification for n proofs
- **Soundness Error**: 2^(-128) false positive probability

**Performance Metrics**:
- Proof Generation: 2.3ms (median, 64-bit range)
- Proof Verification: 1.1ms (median, single proof)
- Batch Verification: 0.4ms per proof (100+ batch)
- Memory Usage: 4.8KB during generation
- Aggregated Proof Size: 672 + 32n bytes (n inputs)

### Private Balances Framework
**Cryptographic Foundation**: Homomorphic Pedersen commitments with cryptographic blinding

**Balance Operations**:
```
Addition: C₁ + C₂ = (v₁ + v₂)G + (r₁ + r₂)H
Subtraction: C₁ - C₂ = (v₁ - v₂)G + (r₁ - r₂)H
Zero-Test: C = 0G + rH iff v = 0 (balance proof)
```

**Commitment Binding**:
```
Binding: Given C, computationally infeasible to find (v', r') ≠ (v, r) 
         such that C = v'G + r'H
Hiding: C computationally indistinguishable from random group element
```

Technical specifications:
- **Group**: Ristretto255 (prime order ℓ = 2^252 + 27742317777372353535851937790883648493)
- **Commitment Size**: 32 bytes (compressed Ristretto point)
- **Blinding Factor**: 256-bit cryptographically secure random
- **Homomorphic Property**: Addition/subtraction in commitment space
- **Security**: DDH assumption on Ristretto255

### Privacy Credits Economy
**Economic Model**: Computational cost-based pricing with stake-weighted allocation

**Credit Generation Formula**:
```
Credits_Generated = (Stake_Amount × Base_Rate × Time_Factor) / Total_Network_Stake
where:
- Base_Rate = 1000 credits per 100 UNIT tokens per epoch
- Time_Factor = linear multiplier based on stake duration
- Epoch = 600 blocks (~1 hour at 6s block time)
```

**Operational Costs**:
```
Key Registration: 50 credits (one-time setup)
Private Transfer: 125 credits (per transaction including stealth output)
Ring Signature: 75 credits (anonymous signing with 64-member ring)
Balance Query: 10 credits (encrypted balance retrieval)
Stealth Scan: 1 credit per 1000 blocks scanned
ZK Proof Generation: 150 credits (complex multi-input transactions)
```

Technical parameters:
- **Credit Precision**: 64-bit unsigned integers
- **Minimum Stake**: 1,000,000 UNIT tokens (1M UNIT)
- **Credit Conversion**: 100 credits per UNIT token staked
- **Maximum Credits**: 2^64 per account (18.4 quintillion)
- **Credit Decay**: None (permanent until spent)
- **Transfer Granularity**: 1 credit minimum

## Blockchain Visibility Analysis

**On-Chain Observable Data**:
1. **Token Acquisition Events**: Public token transfers (amounts visible)
2. **Stake-to-Credit Conversions**: Stake amounts and credit allocations
3. **Key Registration Transactions**: Public keys only (no linking data)
4. **Encrypted Transaction Envelopes**: Ciphertext and proof data only
